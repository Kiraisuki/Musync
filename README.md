# Musync
A simple file syncing program for Android

# How to use

Open the app on an Android device and enter a URL into the text box. The URL should point to a text file containing a list of all the files available to download, with each filename on a separate line. Files will be downloaded sequentially in the order they appear in the text document and they will be stored in the /musync folder on your Android device's internal storage. Musync does not currently support downloading files in separate directories from the filelist.
